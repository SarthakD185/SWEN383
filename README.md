The election app works by running the NUTRIApp file in the NutriApp folder (src->nutriApp).
The user will be prompted to register if it is there first time and there profile information will be collected.
Afterwards, they can select options from the menu to log their food, workouts, and add to a shopping list. 
There is a exit option for them if they want to leave.
Some menu options contain submenus, but redirect the user back to the main menu upon request.
